# Word-Search-Puzzle
This project is a console-based Word Puzzle Game written in C++. Players need to guess words from a pre-defined dictionary, and they earn points for each correct guess. The game provides options to start a new game, resume a game, or view the high score. The game board and dictionary are read from external files.
